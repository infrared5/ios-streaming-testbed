#Remote Procedure Calls

`R5Stream.send` allows the publisher to send messages to the server to be sent to all subscribers.


###Example Code
- ***[PublishRemoteCallTest.swift](PublishRemoteCallTest.swift)***
- ***[SubscribeRemoteCallTest.swift](SubscribeRemoteCallTest.swift)***

- ***[BaseTest.swift](../BaseTest.swift)***

##Running the example
Two devices are required to run this example.  One as a publisher, and the other as a subscriber. 

Connect the first device (publisher) with the Publish - Remote Call example. On the second device (subscriber) use the Subscribe - Remote Call example.

Touch the preview on the publisher screen to display a label on the subscriber screen where the publisher touched.


##Using the R5Stream send
Once the stream has connected you are able to dispatch messages to any connected subscribers.  Sending the message is a simple call:

```Swift
publishStream?.send("whateverFunctionName", withParam: sendString)
```
<sup>
[PublishRemoteCallTest.swift #60](PublishRemoteCallTest.swift#L60)
</sup>

###Send Message Format
The publisher send has a specific parameter format that must be observed.  A single string variable is able to be sent, and contains a map of all key-value pairs sepereated by a semi-colon.

```Swift
"key1=value1;key2=value2;key3=value3;"
```
Not using this format can result in parsing failure on the server and messages will not be dispatched.

##Receiving R5Stream send calls
In order to handle `R5Stream.send` calls from the publisher, the `R5Stream.client` delegate must be set.  This delegate will receive all `R5Stream.send` messages via appropriately named methods.

```Swift
self.subscribeStream?.client = self;
```
<sup>
[SubscribeRemoteCallTest.swift #27](SubscribeRemoteCallTest.swift#L27)
</sup>

Because the publisher will be sending **whateverFunctionName**, the subscriber client delegate will need a matching method signature. As the name implies, the function can be named anything as long as it is publicly accessible. All methods receive a single string argument containing the variable map provided by the publisher.  This map can easily be parsed.

```Swift
func whateverFunctionName(message: String){
        
	NSLog("Got this message: " + message)
        
	let splitMessage = message.characters.split(";").map(String.init)
        
	var message : String = ""
	var point : CGPoint = CGPoint()
        
	for item in splitMessage {
            
		let itemSplit = item.characters.split("=").map(String.init)
		let size = self.view.frame.size
		switch itemSplit[0] {
		case "message":
			message = itemSplit[1]
			break
		case "touchX":
			point.x = CGFloat((itemSplit[1] as NSString).doubleValue) * size.width
			break
		case "touchY":
			point.y = CGFloat((itemSplit[1] as NSString).doubleValue) * size.height
			break
        default:
            break
        }
    }
```
